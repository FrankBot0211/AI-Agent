### Reference from Document 121-0218 REV. 92
1. **ADVI Process Flow**: 
   - The document mentions the transition to Converged ADVI operations, combining previous separate aFVI and MTI operations (document reference page 113). 

2. **Sorting Configurations**:
   - Section 11.2.2: Details on sorting configurations for ADVI, which may include specifics on introducing lots, are provided (document reference page 116).

For a complete introduction procedure, if more information is necessary and not found, consider reviewing the ICOS T130 Recipe Uploads (page 111), which could outline precise steps.

Unfortunately, due to the redacted nature of the documents, not all steps of introducing a lot at ADVI might be accessible through this segment. For further details, consult complete sections of these documents directly if possible.
