Based on the provided information from Document 121-0218 REV. 92, I've compiled the following detailed report:

The ADVI process flow in the document highlights the transition to Converged ADVI operations, effectively combining the previously separate aFVI and MTI operations. This significant change is mentioned on page 113.

For details on sorting configurations specific to ADVI, Section 11.2.2 provides comprehensive information. This section is crucial as it may include the introduction of lots within ADVI processes, and can be referenced on page 116.

Moreover, for those seeking a complete introduction procedure to ADVI operations, although some sections of the documents might be redacted, the ICOS T130 Recipe Uploads detailed on page 111 could serve as an additional source outlining precise steps necessary for implementation.

It is important to remember that due to document redactions, not all steps for introducing a lot at ADVI may be entirely accessible from the information provided here. To gain a full understanding, reviewing the complete sections of these documents is advisable if they are accessible. 

For further exploration or any missing information, it is recommended to consult the mentioned sections directly or related resources such as the ICOS T130 Recipe Uploads for additional clarity.
